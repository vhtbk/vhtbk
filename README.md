## Hi there 👋

My name is Vahit Tabak. I'm a Systems and Site Reliability Engineer with over 16 years of experience running large, complex IT systems. I studied Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering and have worked in both telecoms and academic environments.

I specialise in Linux systems, Identity and Access Management, automation, and Infrastructure as Code.

I've deployed and operated thousands Linux hosts, on-prem Kubernetes clusters, enterprise email platforms, storage and data transfer systems, DNS, monitoring, and network security services, working closely with network engineers, system and database administrators, and developers.

I program confidently in Python and Bash, and most of the systems I support are large-scale, telco-grade services, with a strong focus on security, stability, and reliability.
