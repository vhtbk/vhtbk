## Hi there üëã

My name is Vahit Tabak. I'm a Systems and Site Reliability Engineer with over 15 years of hands-on experience in large and varied IT environments. I studied Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, and I've worked in both telecom and academic sectors.

I have strong skills in Identity and Access Management, large-scale data transfer systems, automation, and keeping services reliable. I have led IAM projects using FreeIPA and 389 Directory Server, and built secure, scalable systems. I've also worked on automating system setup and management with Puppet and Foreman.

I'm comfortable working in both telecom and academic environments, looking after critical systems that need to run without fail. I have solid experience in Linux server administration, monitoring, IAM, and connecting cloud and on-prem systems. I enjoy solving problems, keeping systems stable, and making things easier for teams through good automation and monitoring. I work well with people across the organisation and always aim to deliver secure and reliable services.
