## Hi there 👋

My name is Vahit Tabak. I'm a Systems and Site Reliability Engineer with over 15 years of hands-on experience in large, diverse IT environments. I studied Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, and have worked in both the telecom sector and academic organisation.

I have strong skills in Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure as Code, large-scale data transfer systems, automation, and maintaining reliable services. I've led IAM and IaC projects and have built secure, scalable infrastructure.

I'm comfortable working in both telecom and academic environments, looking after critical systems that need to run without fail. I have solid experience in Linux server administration, IAM, IaC, monitoring, and integrating cloud and on-prem systems. I enjoy solving complex problems, keeping systems stable, and improving workflows through effective automation and monitoring. I collaborate well across teams and always aim to deliver secure, dependable services.
