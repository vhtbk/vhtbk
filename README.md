## Hi there 👋

My name is Vahit Tabak. I’m currently a Senior SRE at [EMBL-EBI](https://ebi.ac.uk/) in Cambridge. I studied electronic engineering and spent nearly a decade working as a systems engineer in the telecommunications sector. After moving to England, I continued to take on sysadmin/SRE roles at EMBL-EBI.

My expertise includes data center management, backbone operations, infrastructure automation, observability, and identity management. I am proficient in technologies such as RHEL, Debian, Kubernetes, Puppet, VMware, DNS, Email Management, and Identity Management.
